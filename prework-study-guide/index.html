        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hyptertext Markup Language</li>
          <li>Elements seen on page (Text, Image, Header, List)</li>
          <li>Elements used to divide and describe page (Meta-related, Content division, Semantic)</li>
          <li>HTML is used to build a sturdy frame</li>
          <li>Head element contains metadata that helps the browser render the page.  Head elements are no visible to user.</li>
          <li>Head element contains chartset, http-equiv, and viewport</li>
          <li>Elements used to render page correctly: !DOCTYPE html, html, head, meta, title</li>
          <li>Inside the head element we can use title, style, base, link, and meta</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>Elements nested inside other elements are called child elements.  The body is the parent element</li>
          <li>Element refers to entire element from opening to closing tag.  Tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets</li>
          <li>Child elements: ul, ol, li, p (paragraph), h (header), img, br (break), a (anchor)</li>
          <li>src attribute defines location of image</li>
          <li>alt attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
         <li>CSS defines style to a webpage</li>
         <li>Three ways to style a webpage: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet</li>
         <li>Inline CSS applies to a specific HTML tag, a particular page element.  Useful for quick and permanent changes.</li>
         <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
         <li>external CSS style sheet is the most common way to style a webpage.  It allows devs to keep all their rules in a seperate file, making changes easier.</li>
         <li>Seperation of concerns is based on the idea that each section of code should have its own responsibility</li>
         <li>Declarations contain two important components: the property and the value (color: blue;)</li>
         <li>* is a special wild card symbol, its applies a rule to all elements visible on a page.</li>
         <li>A comma allows declarations to affect both sectors, two or more elements that will share the same styling can be grouped together.  DRY code.</li>
         <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
         <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
         <li>style sheet is linked to index in the head section, this is where we store metadata (information not visibile to user)</li>
        </ul>
