# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The prework study guide has showed me elementary steps and concepts for web development that I am excited to build upon.  I've built this project to start thinking with the mindset of a Developer and start getting familiar with routitnes that my future career might have.  In a matter of a few days, I have become familiar with Git Bash and GitHub.  I believe I have been "sloppy" with a lot of the commands but with time, I'm excited to get more comfortable and sure footed when building branches and adding new features.

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide offers notes about 4 topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.  For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing "Command+Option+I" (MacOS) or "Control+Shift+I" (Windows).  A console panel should be open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser.  A list of topics I have learned from the Preowkrk along with a random suggestion of what to study first should be visible to the user.
